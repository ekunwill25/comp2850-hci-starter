## Post-Session Debrief

**Subjective ratings**:
- Overall confidence: 4 / 5  
- Ease of use: 4 / 5  
- Would recommend: 3 / 5  

**Open questions**:

1. *Most confusing?*  
   - “Reloads make it harder to track where I was.”

2. *What worked well?*  
   - “Forms and buttons behaved predictably.”

3. *Accessibility barriers?*  
   - “None beyond refresh jumps.”

**Participant suggestions**:
- “Maybe highlight the updated task after reload?”

## Facilitator Reflection

- No-JS still fully functional — parity mostly achieved.
- Reloads create mild disorientation but not task failures.
- Good confirmation of progressive enhancement strategy.
