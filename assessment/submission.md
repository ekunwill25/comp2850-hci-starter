## 1. Protocol & Tasks
## Week 6 Job Story #1 (Productivity theme)
-  When I’m trying to manage multiple tasks quickly, I want a simple list and fast interactions so I don’t waste time navigating UI. 
- How Task 1 tests this: Task 1 checks if users can add new tasks rapidly without confusion.

## Evaluation Tasks (4 tasks)
## T1 – Add Task

- Scenario: User wants to add a new item during busy workflow
- Action: “Add a task called ‘Buy milk’”
- Success: New task appears at bottom of list
- Target time: 8–10s
- Linked to: Job Story #1

## T2 – Edit Task
- Scenario: User needs to quickly rename an item
- Action: “Edit the task you just added to say ‘Buy oat milk’”
- Success: Updated title visible
- Target time: 10–12s
- Linked to: Job Story #1

## T3 – Mark Complete
- Scenario: User tracks progress
- Action: “Mark the task you edited as completed”
- Success: Completed state visible
- Target time: 6–8s
- Linked to: Job Story #1

## T4 – Delete Task
- Scenario: User removes unnecessary tasks
- Action: “Delete the task you just completed”
- Success: Task disappears
- Target time: 6–8s
- Linked to: Job Story #1

## 2. Findings Table (short + single sentence each)
Finding│Data Source│Observation│WCAG│Impact│Inclusion│Effort│Priority
F1 – edit button unclear│P1,P3 notes│“Which icon edits?”│3.3.2│4│3│2│5
F2 – delete has no confirmation│P2,P4│“It just vanished”│3.3.3│5│4│3│6
F3 – success message not announced│P2,P5│“I didn’t know it saved”│4.1.3│5│5│3│7
F4 – long list difficult to scan│P1,P5│“Hard to find old tasks”│2.4.1│4│4│2│6
F5 – keyboard focus unclear│P3,P5│“Where am I?”│2.4.7│5│5│3│7

## Top priorities
- F5 – unclear focus (7)
- F3 – message not announced (7)
- F2 – missing delete confirmation (6)

## Participant summary:
- P1 — Standard mouse
- P2 — Keyboard only
- P3 — Standard HTMX
- P4 — No-JS fallback
- P5 — Screen reader
- n = 5

## 4. Implementation Diffs
## Fix 1 – Add role="alert" to success messages
- Addresses: F3
- What changed: Added role="alert" to status message
- Why: Makes messages programmatically announced (4.1.3)
- Impact: Screen-reader users now hear confirmation

## Fix 2 – Add delete confirmation dialog

- Addresses: F2
- What changed: Added confirm('Delete?') before POST
- Why: Prevents accidental destructive action
- Impact: Users felt safer deleting items

## Fix 3 – Improve keyboard focus outline

- Addresses: F5
- What changed: Added CSS focus outline on buttons
- Why: Supports keyboard + SR users
- Impact: P5 reported “I know where I am now”

## 5. Verification Results
## Part A – Regression (summary)

- Pass: 17/20
- Fail: 3/20

## Critical failures: none after Fix #3

- Part B – Before/After
- Metric	Before	After	Change	Target
- SR error detection	0%	100%	+100%	✅
- Delete error rate	30%	0%	-30%	✅
- Focus visibility	Poor	Clear	✓	Yes
- Status messages	Silent	Announced	✓	Yes
- Re-pilot: P5 – SR user – after fixes – reported improvement

## 6. Evidence Folder Contents (summary)
## Screenshots
File│Description
t2-validation-error.png│Missing alert role
t3-add-success.png│No live region
t4-delete-confirmation.png│Confirm displayed
focus-outline.png│New focus indicator

## Pilot Notes

- P1: struggled identifying edit button
- P2: delete seemed instantaneous
- P3: keyboard navigation worked but unclear
- P4: no-JS acceptable
- P5: SR missed success notice (fixed later)

## Evidence Chain Example

Finding F3 – success not announced
→ P2 notes timestamp 13:26 “didn’t know it saved”
→ Screenshot t3-add-success.png
→ Fix #1 role="alert"
→ Verification: NVDA announced correctly
